# Google Book Search

## Overview
In this activity, we create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This app construction used React components, helper/util functions, and utilized React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books as favorites. I have added added an email function that will search a specific user's favorites in the database based on the given email address.
